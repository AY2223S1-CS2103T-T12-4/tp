## Command format

_To be cleaned up_

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* All flags and options must be specified before any prefix or parameter.

* Flags can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-p PATIENT_INDEX -t TASK_INDEX`, `-t TASK_INDEX -p PATIENT_INDEX` is also acceptable.

* There must be a space separating a flag and an option.

* All indices ***must be a positive integer*** 1, 2, 3, â€¦

* `PATIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.

* Indices for patient attributes (e.g. `TASK_INDEX`, `CONDITION_INDEX`, `TAG_INDEX`, etc.) refers to the index number shown in the attribute list of a patient.<br>
  e.g. `TASK_INDEX` refers to the index number show in the task list of a patient.

* Parameters in square brackets and angle brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  e.g. `d/TASK_DESCRIPTION | <DATE TIME> | <INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD>` can be used as `d/task 1` or `d/task 1 | 22-3-22 1800`.

* Parameters with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

Things to add:
- explain pipe characters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parameter constraints

_To be cleaned up_

### `n/NAME`

`NAME` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.

Example: `n/John Doe`

### `p/PHONE`

`PHONE` should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long.

Example: `p/91234567`

### `e/EMAIL`

_Use the one from MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS_

### `a/ADDRESS`

`ADDRESS` accepts any values.

Example:`a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

### `t/TAG`

`TAG` accepts any values.

Example:`t/12-A nursing home`

### `d/TASK_DESCRIPTION | DATE TIME | INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD`

_To be added_

### `c/CONDITION`

`CONDITION` accepts any values.

Example:`c/Parkinson's disease`

### `m/MEDICATION | DOSAGE`

_To be added_

### `r/REMARK`

_To be added_


_Clean up Task parameters, some should be put in the feature, while things like date format maybe be put in this section_
### Task parameters
* A task is specified using two pieces of information: `TASK_DESCRIPTION` and `DATE TIME`.
* `TASK_DESCRIPTION` can be any non-empty string made of alphanumeric characters.
* `DATE TIME` must be of the form d-M-yy HHmm, but the time is optional. <br>
  e.g. `2-7-22 1345`, `28-10-22` are valid dates.
* Although time can be omitted, this will result in the task being created with a default time of `0000` hours.
* `DATE TIME` itself can be omitted as well, this will result in the task being created with a task date and time of 24 hours from the moment of creation.
* A task can be recurring, i.e if the Task date passes, it will automatically generate the next Task based on the recurrence.
* A recurring task can be specified using parameters `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD`, in addition to the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` and `DATE TIME`.
* `TIME_PERIOD` can be: `day`/`days`, `week`/`weeks`, `month`/`months` or `year`/`years`
* `INTERVAL` specifies the amount of such time periods between recurring tasks, and must be a **positive integer**.
* Examples of valid `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` are: `3 days`, `7 weeks`, `2 months`.
* Note that while a task can be created without `DATE TIME`, a recurring task must have a `DATE TIME`.
