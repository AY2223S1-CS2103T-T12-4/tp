## Contributions to project

### New feature: added the ability to have recurring tasks.

Added the ability to add and modify recurring tasks
* What it does: Recurring tasks can be specified with a recurrence, then it would automatically generate the next task once the upcoming task has passed its task date
* Justification: Tasks that are recurring can be common for nurses and it can be tedious for them to manually generate them by adding a new one frequently. Recurring tasks removes the tedious aspect and makes it easier for them
* Highlights:
* Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
