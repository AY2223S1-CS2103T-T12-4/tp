## Contributions to project

### New feature: Listing all tasks

Added the ability to view the list of tasks for all patients.
* What it does: Allows the user to view all tasks for all patients in a separate view provided in the output panel of the GUI.
* Justification: It allows the user to only view the tasks for all patients and does not display the other details of the patient, allowing the user to focus on the list of tasks that are presented.
* Highlights:
* Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
